# InstaBot
Use selenium to access your Instagram account and automate commenting.

I wrote this code using Selenium. 
Using this code you can automate logging into your instagram account and proceed to comment on your hashtags of choince.



## Usage

1. Since instagram mostly blocks automated actions, some random elements has been implemented to prevent that. You can add more random elements to this code using 
Time.sleep() function or create more hashtags and comments that are randomly chosen.

2. You can change hashtags and comments as you prefer.

3. In each hashtag, this code chooses different posts based on its random choice in order to add more randomness. You could increase the number of choices it has as well.

4. The next expansion could be to use a LLM to read the captions of each post and comment accordingly. 

## Caution

Any usage of this code should be done at your own discretion and i'm not responsible for your losses!
